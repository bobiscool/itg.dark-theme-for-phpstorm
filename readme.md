# itg.dark Theme for PHPStorm

------------
This is a PHPStorm version of the [dark itg-flat](https://github.com/itsthatguy/theme-itg-flat) theme available for Sublime, originally by [Kevin Altman](https://github.com/itsthatguy).

Whilst the theme is intended to be faithful to the original, it's not an exact copy. This is due to nuances in the Sublime theming that can't be recreated within PHPStorm (or in IntelliJ based IDEs). 

IntelliJ based IDEs treat language keywords, like `function`, `use` & `return`, quite broadly. They don't (currently) offer a way to have specific colourings for specific keywords - so all language-specific keywords are the same colour.

## Installation (on Mac)

Download and copy the `itg_dark.icls` file into your `~/Library/Preferences/WebIdeXX/colors` folder. 

Please note that the `XX` denotes whatever version of PHPStorm you're using. 

For example, `80` for v8, `90` for version v9. `95` for v10 EAP.

Then, in PHPStorm, go to:

> `Preferences` > `Editor` > `Colors & Fonts` > Select `itg.dark` from the `Scheme` dropdown
